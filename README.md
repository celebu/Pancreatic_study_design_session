# Pancreatic_study_design_session

The purpose of this 1h30 activity is to give students the opportunity to think about the issues involved in designing case-control and cohort studies (future development: think about adding a cross-sectional study and a randomised control trial). The activity is designed to be used both for face-to-face teaching and for distant learners, with the due adaptations. A sheet will be handed out with the scenario and the scheme here included, and another, pre-filled with answers will be made available at the end of the activity.

Structure: 

- `Stat5_student`: document containing scenario and worksheet to be handed out to students.
- `Stat5_tutor`: detailed annotations on how to lead the activity, with timing.
- `Stat5_answers`: pre-filled worksheet to be made available to students at the end of the activity.
